Determine purchasing priority and ownership based on the cost of the new materials\nIncorrect. The price of the materials should not set the priority of purchasing new project materials unless this is formally agreed upon by all parties. The higher cost of materials does not necessarily equate to a higher priority.\nB. Assign ownership to the requestor with the highest priority and nearest term need\nIncorrect. Priority may drive many of the decisions as to which materials to procure. Nonetheless, the ownership of costs is not to be placed solely on the stakeholder with the highest priority and nearest term needs. The ownership of project costs is not equal to procurement priority.\nC. Facilitate an agreement between stakeholders on priority, ownership, and purchasing\nCorrect. Facilitating and documenting an agreement regarding the purchasing and the priority of the procurement needs with all parties ensures alignment on the project. This documentation communicates the handling of procurement for ongoing benefit realization.\nD. Procure new materials in the order of how the purchasing requests come in\nIncorrect. A \"first in, first out\" (FIFO) approach may be suitable for some situations where all things are known to be equal for delivering ongoing project benefits.

With an adaptive life cycle, as opposed to a predictive life cycle, the detailed scope is defined and approved before the start of each iteration. A predictive life cycle approach does not utilize iterations.\nD. Revising cost and time estimates as the project team's understanding of the product increases\nIncorrect.

After three iterations, a functional prototype is ready, but it lacks critical safety features as well as several enhancements that can be installed on-site in future releases. To get early feedback from the client, the product owner requests that the team deliver an MVP as soon as possible.\n\nWhat should the project manager do to address the product owner's request?",

        "explain": "A minimum viable product (MVP) is the smallest set of tested and consumer-ready functionality that provides value to either internal users or external customers. In this scenario, the prototype lacks critical safety features, which means that it is not consumer-ready. It would be irresponsible, as well as a violation of the PMI Code of Ethics, to release equipment to a customer that might be dangerous due to the lack of safety features. Although an MVP may include only limited features, safety features would be required to meet the criteria as an MVP. Therefore, in this case, the project manager should ensure that all safety features are installed and working properly to meet the criteria as an MVP and then deliver the equipment to the client.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Install safety features and enhancements on the prototype and deliver it to the client\nIncorrect. To meet the criteria as an MVP, the safety features must be installed. However, the additional enhancements are not required to be part of the MVP. Waiting for the installation of the enhancements when the equipment is functional without them would delay the early feedback requested by the product owner.\nB. Install only the safety features on the prototype and deliver it to the client\nCorrect. The agile team can only release a product (a prototype in this case) once it meets the criteria for a minimum viable product (MVP). An MVP may include a minimal set of features but still must be consumer-ready. Safety features must be included and tested before releasing an MVP to the client.\nC.

The project manager's role in a weak matrix organization is part-time and done as part of another job and not a designated job role like a coordinator. In such an organization, the project manager's authority over resources is low, and it is the functional manager who takes on the responsibility of managing resources.

However, removing the vendor from consideration for future work requires an update to the prequalified seller lists and the seller performance evaluation documentation rather than the lessons learned register.\nB. Recommendation to include the vendor for future projects\nIncorrect. The vendor ran behind schedule by performing work not specified in the contract. Based on the limited information presented in the scenario, it is unlikely that the vendor would be recommended for use on future projects.

The other is in the values that drive how teams choose to work together.\" These are values that agile practitioners share within the broader agile community. Incorporating community and stakeholder values while delivering agile projects is essential to the success of the project.

Communication is one of the basic agile values that is embedded in all agile events: daily stand up meetings, reviews, retrospectives.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Promote the company's success and prosperity\nIncorrect. Promoting a company’s success and prosperity is a goal of every organization. However, this value is not unique to the eXtreme Programming (XP) software development method.\nB. Endorse courage, respect, and communication\nCorrect. Courage, respect, and communication are all outlined in the Agile Manifesto and are key to the successful implementation of any agile method. These are core values of the eXtreme Programming (XP) method.\nC. Respect practitioners from different cultures\nIncorrect. Modern projects are often carried out by geographically distributed teams and/or team members who come from different countries and cultures.

        "answer4": "By progressively elaborating the initial plans with new information",
        "answer5": "",
        "explain": "Predictive and agile project life cycles differ from one another in several aspects. One of them is the way cost and risk are controlled. Predictive projects develop detailed plans up-front, including the cost baseline and risk responses. The risk responses are planned with the allocated contingency reserves that are part of the cost baseline. Then, as the project progresses, the actual costs are compared to the cost baseline, and variances, if found, are controlled using dedicated tools and techniques. Agile projects, on the other hand, adapt almost in real-time as new requirements and constraints emerge. The most typical way for an agile project to control cost and risk is to update the product backlog with the new information and re-prioritize the backlog based on the highest value for the customer, thus resulting in a risk-adjusted backlog. Everything in between falls under the hybrid project life cycle category. With hybrid project life cycles, the product can be divided into subsets, which are delivered at either pre-defined intervals or as soon as the subsets are completed. Plans are created for these product subsets and are then further elaborated with the new information as it becomes available, which, in turn, allows to control cost and risk accordingly.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. By adhering to the cost baseline and implementing risk responses\nIncorrect. Adhering to the cost baseline and implementing risk responses is a typical approach to control cost and risk on projects that are lead using the predictive project management approach. Hybrid projects, like the one described in the scenario, use more flexible methods.\nB. By grooming the backlog as requirements and constraints emerge\nIncorrect. The approach to control cost and risk described in this answer choice is usually taken on agile projects. New requirements and constraints that emerge as the project progresses are evaluated, incorporated into the product backlog, and prioritized according to the customer value.\nC. By increasing the cost baseline for each newly identified risk\nIncorrect. While cost baseline is a sign that the project is likely managed using a predictive approach, increasing the cost baseline for each newly identified risk is a flawed practice. New risks should first be evaluated, and responses planned. However, not every risk response requires a contingency reserve that would result in an increase in the cost baseline.\nD. By progressively elaborating the initial plans with new information\nCorrect. Hybrid projects typically have initial plans, at least for the next product subset to be developed.

Require the seller to deliver earlier than needed to accommodate repairs of poor quality deliverables\nIncorrect. The assumption should not be that the seller is to constantly provide poor quality or incomplete work. The project team and the supplier must work together to ensure the requirements and the quality standards are understood and adhered to. Forcing the seller to deliver early with the assumption the deliverables do not meet expectations erodes trust between buyer and seller.\nB. Reduce the number of metrics to optimize the cost of quality and associated assets\nIncorrect. Reducing the measurements and quality metrics does not increase quality without a compelling reason as to why and how. Metrics are a means to check and assure quality.

The decision tree is evaluated by calculating the expected monetary value of each branch, which involves multiplying the probability by the impact of each chance and adding the results together.\nIn this scenario, you have the quantified probabilities and impacts of the chances that two different vendors will deliver in one month or two. You can calculate the expected monetary value (EMV) of each vendor's risks, and select the vendor with the highest EMV.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Monte Carlo analysis\nIncorrect. Monte Carlo analysis is a form of simulation, which is one of the data analysis techniques used for the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. However, the Monte Carlo analysis simulates the combined effects of individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty to output the probability of certain events occurring and the level of confidence that a specific event will occur. The information given in the question is not enough to complete a Monte Carlo analysis.\nB. Sensitivity analysis\nIncorrect. Sensitivity analysis helps to determine, which individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty have the most potential impact on project outcomes. A typical display of sensitivity analysis is the tornado diagram, which presents the correlation coefficient for each risk that can influence the project outcome. The information given in the question is not enough to complete a tornado diagram.\nC. Decision tree analysis\nCorrect. Decision trees are used to support the selection of several different courses of action, each of which has potential opportunities and threats.

Influence analysis is not a technique named in the PMBOK® Guide. On the other hand, influence diagrams are one of the data analysis techniques that can be used in the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process to represent a set of entities, outcomes, and influences. The influence diagram can use ranges or probability distributions to represent uncertainty. However, the information given in the question is not enough to complete an influence diagram.",

        "explain": "The interpersonal skill described by the question is emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence (EI), and its corresponding metric emotional intelligence quotient (EQ) is different from traditional intelligence or just being ‘smart'. It is considered the ability to understand your own emotions and the emotions of others in order to interact successfully with them on your projects, especially agile projects where interpersonal communication and collaboration is of the utmost importance. Emotional intelligence also includes the capacity to reason about emotions in order to enhance thinking. The benefits of learning these emotional intelligence traits, and they can be learned, is that they allow agile leaders to motivate better, lead, collaborate, and negotiate with team members and stakeholders.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Servant leadership\nIncorrect. Servant leadership is a set of agile strategies and practices that is founded on the goal of serving other project team members and stakeholders first, and in doing so effectively determining and meeting the needs of these project team members and stakeholders in order to benefit them. The ability to understand human motivation, expression and dynamics is only briefly related to servant leadership.\nB. Conflict resolution\nIncorrect. Conflict resolution involves the use of various techniques to resolve and settle conflicts that occur between those individuals working on your agile project to ensure the ability to work together effectively and continuously throughout the life cycle of the project. While conflict resolution requires the understanding of human motivation, expression, and dynamics, it is unlikely, on its own, to be responsible for the agile coach's success.\nC. Emotional intelligence\nCorrect. In addition to servant leadership, agile leaders emphasize their interpersonal and emotional intelligence skills. Emotional intelligence (EI) is considered the ability to understand your own emotions and the emotions of others in order to successfully interact with them.\nD. Adaptive leadership\nIncorrect. Adaptive leadership is a set of strategies and practices that agile project teams can implement to overcome roadblocks, to employ meaningful and valuable change where necessary, and to increase their adaptability. The goal of adaptive leadership is to create a culture where adaptability is encouraged and nurtured and can thrive. Adaptive leadership could be partially responsible for the agile coach's success.

        "explain": "A project life cycle is the series of phases that a project passes through from its start to its completion. (Note, the word \"phase\" in this context is used differently from how it's used in multi-phase projects). The project life cycle provides the basic framework for managing the project. Predictive, iterative, incremental, adaptive, hybrid are examples of a project life cycle. The selection of the life cycle depends on project characteristics. There are various models that can be used to describe project characteristics. One of them is the Stacey Complexity Model. The model addresses the degree of uncertainty as it relates to the project requirements on the one hand and how to fulfill those requirements using current knowledge and technology on the other hand. The technical degree of uncertainty is mapped on the horizontal axis, and the uncertainty of requirements is on the vertical axis. According to the model, as project uncertainty increases along any of those dimensions, so too does the risk of rework and the need to use a different project management approach.\nWhen project requirements, as well as the technology to implement these requirements, are clear, the predictive project life cycle is typically the way to go. As the degree of uncertainty increases, the likelihood of changes, risk, and rework increases as well. Such projects would benefit from either iterative, incremental, adaptive, or hybrid life cycles. When both the technical degree of uncertainty and the degree of uncertainty in project requirements is very high, a project is considered chaos (or anarchy). Managing such a project is very hard to impossible.\nIn the scenario, the project requirements are unstable, meaning the degree of requirements uncertainty is high. However, the team feels very confident with the technology to implement the requirements, suggesting the technical degree of uncertainty is low to medium. Based on these findings, the team selects an adaptive project life cycle, implying the project has been mapped within area C.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. A\nIncorrect. Area A represents a low degree of both technical uncertainty and requirements uncertainty. Projects that are mapped within this area are referred to as simple projects and would benefit from a predictive life cycle. In the scenario, the team selects an adaptive life cycle, making this choice an incorrect answer.\nB. B\nIncorrect. Area B represents a low-to-medium degree of both technical uncertainty and requirements uncertainty. Projects that are mapped within this area are referred to as complicated projects and would benefit from one of the adaptive life cycles. While in the scenario, the team selects an adaptive life cycle, the degree of uncertainty in the project requirement is very high, implying the project is likely mapped outside of area B.\nC. C\nCorrect. Area C represents projects with one uncertainty aspect being high and the other uncertainty aspect being low-to-medium. Projects that are mapped within this area are referred to as complex projects and would benefit from an adaptive life cycle. In the scenario, the degree of uncertainty in the project requirement is very high, but the team is familiar with the technology, implying the technical degree of uncertainty is low. Also, the team selected an adaptive life cycle, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.\nD. D\nIncorrect. Area B represents a high degree of both technical uncertainty and requirements uncertainty. Projects that are mapped within this area are referred to as chaotic (or anarchy) projects and are unlikely to be even selected as feasible. In the scenario, the project has already been selected.

The qualifications only selection method applies when the time and cost of a full selection process would not make sense because the value of the procurement is relatively small. The buyer establishes a shortlist (represented by the three prospective vendors under consideration in this scenario) and selects the bidder with the best credibility, qualifications, experience, expertise, areas of specialization, and references. Therefore, of the available choices, establishing a qualifications only selection method to select the vendor is the best course of action.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Utilize a sole source for the procurement\nIncorrect. With a sole source procurement, the buyer asks a specific seller to prepare technical and financial proposals, which are then negotiated.

The qualifications only selection method applies when the time and cost of a full selection process would not make sense because the value of the procurement is relatively small.\nD. Conduct a bidder conference\nIncorrect. The question states that the value of the procurement is relatively small, and a full selection process does not make sense. A bidder conference is a meeting with prospective sellers prior to the preparation of a bid or proposal to ensure all prospective vendors have a clear and common understanding of the procurement.

Release the project team to start the next project\nIncorrect. The question suggests that the Close Project or Phase process is being performed. The project team is released during this process, but the project team must complete all of the other activities associated with project closure before they can all be released. Since there is not enough information in the question to determine if all other closure activities have already been completed, releasing the project team is not the best answer to the question asked.\nB.

        "answer5": "",
        "explain": "The scenario describes a hybrid project that combines elements of a traditional project (a project management plan, scope baseline, etc.) with agile elements (Scrum, sprints, etc.). The safety regulations are an example of a mandatory external requirement that represents a constraint to the project and are included among the enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) under which the project operates. Even though the addition of the new safety features is mandatory, an approved change request is still required since the project is operating under the auspices of an approved project management plan and the scope baseline. At a minimum, the scope baseline will need to be revised to incorporate the additional scope. It is also possible that the cost and schedule baseline will be affected as well. Thus, the project manager will need first to submit a change request to update the project management plan. Once the change request has been approved, the features can be incorporated into the project's scope.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Issue a change request to update the project management plan and, once approved, ensure that the scope baseline is updated\nCorrect. Since the project is operating under the auspices of a project management plan, including the scope baseline, an approved change request would be required to modify any aspect of the project management plan, such as the scope baseline. Once approved, the additional scope can be added and developed.\nB. Conduct a root cause analysts with the product owner to determine why the safety features were not included in the scope in the first place\nIncorrect. Conducting a root cause analysis does not seem appropriate in this case since the scenario implies the regulation is new and likely could not have been anticipated. Regardless of whether the root cause analysis should or should not be conducted, addressing the new safety features is necessary as required by the regulator.\nC. Use the MoSCoW model of prioritization to groom the scope baseline and categorize the new safety features as \"should have\"\nIncorrect. The MoSCoW model of prioritization categories features as \"must have\", \"should have\", \"could have\", and \"won't have\". Regulatory requirements are not optional and should be categorized as \"must have\" rather than \"should have\". Additionally, grooming typically refers to a backlog, not a scope baseline.\nD. Discuss the new features with the team during sprint planning and if the team agrees, ask them to implement the features in the next sprint\nIncorrect. Discussing the features with the team during spring planning would be necessary. However, first, it's not entirely up to the team to decide on what features to implement in a sprint, and, second, with the scope baseline in place, an approved change request will be needed to include new features and have them developed.",

Since the scenario states the project is being executed, it can be inferred the Develop Project Management Plan process has already been performed.\nB. Record the new executive as an issue in the issue log\nIncorrect. The issue log is a project document where information about issues is recorded and monitored.

Meeting with the new executive to review the project charter will help to ensure a common understanding of the key deliverables, milestones, as well as the roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders on the project.\nD. Update the resource breakdown structure\nIncorrect. The resource breakdown structure is a hierarchical representation of resources by category and type.

        "explain": "One of the responsibilities of a project manager is to ensure that team members and stakeholders are adequately trained. In this scenario, a single large training class was conducted for all of the employees (stakeholders). While this probably was the most cost-efficient way of delivering the training, it clearly was not the most effective. One of the advantages of incremental delivery is the ability to learn from each progressive iteration and apply those learnings to improve the performance of future iterations. In this case, starting with a small group of training, participants should have uncovered the problems with the training so they could be addressed with future groups. By incorporating elements of agile like incremental delivery to an otherwise predictive project, the project becomes a hybrid. Although this strategy may not have prevented a small spike in timesheet issues for the payroll department, the volume of issues would have been greatly reduced, which may have prevented the payroll department from being overwhelmed, delaying the paychecks.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Conducted a project retrospective to gain insights into the problems that occurred\nIncorrect. A project retrospective should be conducted at the end of the project to capture the knowledge gained during the project. Capturing the lessons learned from this project may improve performance for future projects. However, a project retrospective is conducted at the end of the project and would not have prevented any of the problems described in the question.\nB. Included the approval of overtime and bonuses for the payroll department as a risk response\nIncorrect. Risk responses are implemented after a risk has been realized. Risk responses are reactive rather than proactive. In this scenario, the question is asking for a solution that would have 'prevented' the situation, i.e., a proactive rather than a reactive approach.\nC. Captured the problem in the issue log and assigned an owner for monitoring\nIncorrect. In this scenario, the problems should be entered in the issue log along with an assigned owner. However, this action would not have prevented any of the problems from occurring in the first place.\nD. Incorporated incremental delivery along with retrospectives in the project management plan\nCorrect. Incremental delivery of the training would have broken up the training participants into smaller, more manageable groups. By training incrementally, a small subset of the participants could have been trained, and any issues with the course content could have been uncovered during the iteration retrospective.

Political awareness may help the project manager to plan and manage communications, manage and monitor stakeholder engagement, and manage project knowledge. However, among the choices provided, political awareness is the least likely factor to be considered as part of the Estimate Activity Resources process and is, therefore, the best answer to the question asked.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Staff motivation\nIncorrect. When estimating activity durations, the project manager should be aware of staff motivation and consider how quickly and well a team member would perform the project activity. A poorly motivated team member might procrastinate, take too long at a task, or make mistakes that would affect the activity duration.\nB. Number of resources\nIncorrect. A project manager needs to understand the number of resources involved in a project activity since this number would affect the activity duration. At times, adding more resources helps to shorten time to complete a task. However, at some point, adding too many resources to the activity may increase the activity duration due to additional time spent on knowledge transfer, learning, coordination, etc.\nC. Law of diminishing returns\nIncorrect. The law of diminishing returns is a principle in economics that states that in a production process, adding more of one factor in production (such as labor, capital, resource, technology, or overtime), while holding all other factors constant, at some point, will yield a lower incremental return. Thus, the law of diminishing returns should be considered when activity durations are estimated.\nD. Political awareness\nCorrect.

        "answer5": "",
        "explain": "A multi-year manufacturing hybrid project with two-week iteration cycles, such as the one described in the scenario, balances the shorter-term needs in an agile manner and the longer-term needs in a traditional plan-driven manner. Nonetheless, there are budgetary challenges that every project, regardless of the project management approach selected, must address. The larger the scope and the greater the length of a project, the more interdependencies and budget challenges the project may encounter throughout its life cycle. While, according to the scenario, the product of the project will be developed in two-week iterations, the question is asking about addressing the 'longer-term' budget challenges. Therefore, for this hybrid multi-year project, facilitating quarterly reviews of the budget would make the most sense in analyzing the current state as well as exploring and forecasting potential future budget challenges.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Facilitate a quarterly review of the budget and explore potential future budget challenges\nCorrect. The blend of various project management methodologies requires the project team to leverage long term strategies of meeting quarterly to examine and address the budget requirements of the project. The shorter two-week cycles are not sufficient in addressing larger, more complex, budgetary challenges and project interdependencies.\nB. Slowly inject more budgetary constraints and track the budget challenges that these constraints cause\nIncorrect. The issue with the budget in this hybrid project is not the lack of constraints. As such, there is little advantage of injecting more constraints to the budget as the project progresses. Tracking budgetary challenges is a good practice, but not within the constraining measures.\nC. Steadily burn down the budget with every iteration and mitigate budget challenges\nIncorrect. The project budget does get used equally and consumed over the project life cycle. The rate of how the budget is used is typically an S-curve in traditional projects. In a hybrid project, the rate differs. Basing the consumption of the budget on a steady per-iteration rate is most likely not feasible unless the expenditures are consistent and predictable.\nD. Re-evaluate the budget after every iteration and add identified budget challenges to the risk register\nIncorrect. It is true that with the portion of the project managed traditionally, any raised and identified budget risks should be entered into a risk register. However, the other portion of the project that operates on a two-week iteration cycle would be ineffective in analyzing and addressing the budget challenges of this multi-year project",

        "answer4": "Review the cost baseline and project schedule",
        "answer5": "",
        "explain": "The cost variance (CV) is the earned value (EV) less the actual cost (AC). The actual cost is provided as $22,000. Therefore, to calculate the CV, one should obtain the EV. The EV is the budget associated with the authorized work that has been completed. The project manager has to know what work packages have been completed so far and the planned values of these packages. The values of the work packages are represented by the budget allocated for those packages. The cost baseline is the approved version of the time-phased project budget and serves as one of the inputs to the Control Costs process described in the scenario. The cost baseline should specify the cost estimates broken down to the work package level (and even the activity level, if needed). The project schedule, on the other hand, will show what work packages or activities have been completed. Knowing these two elements, the packages/activities that have been completed and their planned values (PVs), the project manager can calculate the EV, and, eventually, the CV as requested by the question.\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Check the project cost management plan\nIncorrect. To calculate the CV, the value of the work completed thus far is needed. The cost management plan is the component of a project management plan that describes how costs will be planned, structured, and controlled. While the cost management plan will provide guidance for the Control Costs process, it does not have the values associated with activities and work packages.\nB. Examine the quality control measurements\nIncorrect. Quality control measurements are the documented results of the activities performed during the Control Quality process. These measurements do not provide information related to the earned value analysis that is required for the calculation of the cost variance as requested by the question.\nC. Look up the budget at completion for the project\nIncorrect. The budget at completion (BAC) is the sum of all budgets established for the work to be performed. To calculate the CV, the value of the work completed thus far is needed. The BAC does not provide work package level detail.\nD. Review the cost baseline and project schedule\nCorrect. The cost variance (CV) is the earned value (EV) less the actual cost (AC). EV is the budget associated with the authorized work that has been completed. The cost baseline should have the cost estimates broken down to the work package level, and the project schedule can indicate the activities that have already been completed.

        "explain": "The amount of information in the scenario may at first overwhelm the PMP aspirant. However, we have to keep in mind that questions on the real exam may contain superfluous information, and the aspirant will need to filter out this unnecessary information and focus on what is relevant.\nThe question is specifically asking for the schedule performance (not cost performance) associated with the seventh sprint (not the whole project). Only the first two bullet points in the performance data provided contain relevant information. It also should be mentioned that project teams do not get credit for the value of rejected features in the earned value calculations. Therefore, in this scenario, it can be said that the team successfully completed only 17 of the 20 story points planned for the sprint.\nThe calculations for the correct answer are as follows:\nSchedule variance (SV) = earned value (EV) - planned value (PV):\n17 - 20 = -3 story points\nSchedule performance index (SPI) = earned value (EV) / planned value (PV):\n17 / 30 = 0.85\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. The schedule variance (SV) is 0 story points, and the schedule performance index (SPI) is 1.0\nIncorrect. If the feature worth three points had been accepted, then the project team would have successfully completed all 20 of the planned story points. In that case, the SV would have been 0, and the SPI would have been 1.0. However, since the feature was rejected, the development team does not get credit for completing that feature.\nB. The cost variance (CV) is $5,000, and the cost performance index (CPI) is 1.03\nIncorrect. This answer choice is providing metrics for cost performance, while the question is asking about schedule performance. Therefore, this answer choice, whether the calculation is true or false, can be eliminated.\nC. The schedule variance (SV) is -3 story points, and the schedule performance index (SPI) is 0.85\nCorrect. The SV can be calculated as the number of story points completed (earned value, EV) less the story points planned (planned value, PV), which is 17-20 for a result of -3 story points. The SPI can be calculated as 17/20 (earned value / planned value), which is 0.85.\nD. There is not enough information in the scenario to determine the schedule performance\nIncorrect. There is enough information in the scenario to determine schedule performance. The schedule performance can be calculated using the following formulas: SV= EV - PV, i.e., 17 - 20 = -3 story points.

        "explain": "The question describes several realized variability risks (such as lower than anticipated worker productivity, errors in construction, as well as worse than expected weather), the combination of which was not accounted for by the individual risk response plans. Variability risks can be addressed using Monte Carlo simulation. A Monte Carlo simulation is an analysis technique where a computer model is iterated many times with the input values chosen at random for each iteration driven by the input data, including probability distributions and probabilistic branches. Variability risks can be analyzed using the Monte Carlo simulation with the range of variation reflected in probability distributions, followed by actions to reduce the spread of possible outcomes. The analysis simulates the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. Thus, performing a Monte Carlo simulation could have led to better risk planning and understanding the combined effects of the individual risks and is, therefore, of the choices provided, the best answer to the question asked.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Conducted a sensitivity analysis\nIncorrect. Sensitivity analysis helps to determine which individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty have the most potential impact on project outcomes. Sensitivity analysis does not analyze the combined effects of individual project risks to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives.\nB. Performed a Monte Carlo simulation\nCorrect. Variability risks can be addressed using Monte Carlo analysis, with the range of variation reflected in probability distributions, followed by actions to reduce the spread of possible outcomes.\nC.

A prototype might be beneficial in addressing ambiguity risks but not variability risks as described by the question.\nD. Applied a decision tree analysis\nIncorrect. Decision tree analysis is a diagramming and calculation technique for evaluating the implications of a chain of multiple options in the presence of uncertainty.

        "explain": "A communications analysis may include a determination of the number of communication channels. The number of potential communication channels or paths can provide information about the complexity of a project's communications.

In this scenario, the stakeholders include the project manager, product owner, four programmers, two testers, and a UX/UI designer, which is a total of nine individuals. Applying the formula for calculating the number of potential communication channels provides 9 x (9 - 1) / 2, which results in 36 communication channels.\nThe topic of this question is only briefly mentioned in the PMBOK® Guide. However, the Project Management Professional (PMP)® Examination Content Outline (ECO) indicates that while there are some commonalities between the PMBOK® Guide and the ECO, the exam is not bound by the PMBOK® Guide. The list of enablers specified in the tasks of the ECO domains is not exhaustive either. The ECO assumes that prospective PMP aspirants are familiar with other sources of information/preparation, including but not limited to PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, PMI’s Practice Standards (e.g., Scheduling, Earned Value Management, etc.); organizational behavior theories such as Tuckman’s Ladder, Theory X and Theory Y, Maslow's hierarchy of needs; commonly frowned upon project management practices, such as gold plating; and others.

        "explain": "The scenario implies the project is planned to be carried out using a predictive project management approach, as evident from the fact the project manager is developing the project baselines. In predictive projects, the work is planned upfront and then executed sequentially according to the project management plan. Once the work is completed and deliverables accepted, the project is closed. If for some reason, the project is terminated prematurely, no value is typically delivered to the customer. In the scenario described, the project is supposed to sequentially prepare infrastructure all across the planned region, then install the meters all across the planned region, and then upload the software all across the planned region. If the project is terminated at any point before the software is uploaded to the first meter, no value is delivered to the customer. The risk of premature closure can be mitigated by incorporating adaptive methods into a predictive project, making the project hybrid. These methods help deliver value frequently and incrementally. For example, the project can prepare infrastructure, install the meters, and upload the software in small chunks, e.g., one neighborhood at a time. With this approach, only if the project is terminated before the moment the software is uploaded to the first meter, no value is delivered. However, since the time required to complete the work in one neighborhood is much shorter than the time required to complete the work all across the planned region, there are more chances the project would deliver some value as opposed to delivering no value. Therefore, of the choices provided, suggesting switching the project from a multi-phase to one-phase approach and completing infrastructure preparation, meters' installation, and software upload in short iterations one neighborhood at a time is the best answer to the question asked.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Request that the local government provide the necessary security measures for the project team members to protect them from the potential confrontation with the anti-wireless-technology groups\nIncorrect. This course of action may \"buy\" some time for the team to complete more work in case the anti-wireless-technology groups try to block project work. However, without going into politics, if the groups are able to obtain a court order to stop the work, the project would be at risk of being terminated prematurely without any value delivered.\nB. Get approval from the sponsor to offer bonuses to those who agree to work extra time to complete the work as fast as possible even if this involves working in shifts during nights and weekends\nIncorrect. This choice describes a plausible action that would likely allow delivering more value as opposed to working regular hours in case the project closes prematurely. However, working extra time over long periods is not sustainable and would negatively impact the motivation and well-being of the project team as well as the quality of deliverables.\nC. Suggest switching the project from a multi-phase to one-phase approach and complete infrastructure preparation, meters' installation, and software upload in short iterations one neighborhood at a time\nCorrect. This incremental adaptive approach will shorten the time period during which at least one meter is up and running and deliver value as opposed to the original approach in which the first meter will be operational only after all infrastructure is prepared, all meters are installed, and the software is uploaded to the first meter.\nD. Recommend project termination since under the circumstances described in the scenario there is no way to complete the project on time, scope and budget, and deliver any value to the customer\nIncorrect.

An agile coach is brought in to conduct a workshop with the project team.\n\nWhat should the project manager do next to verify that the team has acquired the agile skill set needed to meet the project objectives?",
        "answer1": "Facilitate a focus group to evaluate the effectiveness of the workshop and then prepare a team performance assessment",

        "answer4": "Update the RACI chart with the agile knowledge and skills acquired by the project team members during the workshop",
        "answer5": "",
        "explain": "The scenario describes a traditional project in which the product will be developed using agile methods, implying the project overall will be managed using a hybrid framework. Regardless of the approach, evaluating the effectiveness of training delivered to the project team is a good idea. This evaluation would provide the organization with feedback on whether the project team has acquired the knowledge and skills required to achieve the project objectives. The evaluation would also reflect on how well training resources have been spent. In the scenario, the question is specifically asking how to verify the effectiveness of the training. Individual and team assessments are included among the tools and techniques associated with the Develop Team process implied by the scenario. Conducting a focus group is one method of performing individual and team assessments, the results of which should be documented as a team performance assessment, which, in turn, is an output of the Develop Team process.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Facilitate a focus group to evaluate the effectiveness of the workshop and then prepare a team performance assessment\nCorrect. Once training has been completed, the next logical step is to evaluate the effectiveness of the training. Conducting a focus group is one way to perform individual and team assessments. The team performance assessment can then be used to identify any further training that might be needed.\nB. Schedule a team-building event to enhance team cohesiveness, improve collaboration, and strengthen interpersonal skills\nIncorrect. Conducting a team building event to enhance team cohesiveness, collaboration, and interpersonal skills might bring positive benefits to the project. However, the question is asking how to verify that the project team has acquired the skill set necessary to achieve the project objectives, rather than how to develop the project team further.\nC. Hold a retrospective and then submit a change request to update the lessons learned register with the knowledge gained\nIncorrect. Conducting a retrospective would be one way of evaluating the effectiveness of the agile workshop. Even though any knowledge gained from the workshop should be recorded in the lessons learned register, an approved change request is not typically required to update the lessons learned register.\nD. Update the RACI chart with the agile knowledge and skills acquired by the project team members during the workshop\nIncorrect. A RACI chart is a common type of responsibility assignment matrix that uses responsible, accountable, consult, and inform statuses to define the involvement of stakeholders in project activities. The knowledge and skills of the project team members would not be specified in a RACI chart.",

        "question": "A project manager has been reassigned from a traditional project to a hybrid project, in which the progress is measured against the baselines, while the product is developed incrementally over the course of several iterations. In this hybrid environment, the project manager is struggling to find a way to carry out the Monitor Risks process.\n\nWhat tools and techniques would be best for the project manager to use in this situation?",
        "answer1": "Sensitivity analysis, and risk probability and impact assessment",
        "answer2": "Risk-based spikes, architectural spikes, and iteration ‘Zero'",
        "answer3": "Risk burndown charts, daily stand-up meetings, and risk reviews",
        "answer4": "Pair programming, continuous integration, and automated testing",
        "answer5": "",
        "explain": "Risk review is an example of a meeting that can be held as part of the Monitor Risks process on traditionally managed projects. Risk reviews are scheduled regularly and aimed to examine and document the effectiveness of risk responses in dealing with overall project risk and with identified individual project risks. To monitor and control risks on agile projects, practitioners typically use a different set of tools and techniques. On agile projects, risk monitoring activities are embedded as an integral part of the work process. As stated by the authors in the reference, \"Risks are monitored on a daily basis by the use of highly visible information radiators such as task boards and burndown charts, which show the current status. Daily stand-up meetings contribute to the constant monitoring process by exposing potential risk triggers and new risks.\" Individuals who transition from traditional to agile projects sometimes find it hard to adapt to the agile methodology. Therefore, the best solution for the project manager on the hybrid project described in the scenario would be a combination of traditional and agile tools, such as risk burndown charts, daily stand-up meetings, and risk reviews.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Sensitivity analysis, and risk probability and impact assessment\nIncorrect. Sensitivity analysis is one of the data analysis techniques that can be used as part of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. Risk probability and impact assessment is one of the data analysis techniques that can be used during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. The question is asking about the Monitor Risks process.\nB. Risk-based spikes, architectural spikes, and iteration ‘Zero'\nIncorrect. A risk-based spike is a time-boxed effort to investigate an issue or risk. Carrying out the risk-based spike may help avoid risk. However, iteration 'Zero' and/or an architectural spike do not address the issue. For example, iteration ‘Zero’ is used by agile teams to set up a development environment, while an architectural spike is a time-boxed effort to verify the feasibility of a technical approach.\nC. Risk burndown charts, daily stand-up meetings, and risk reviews\nCorrect. A risk burndown chart is an information radiator that shows risk exposure remained over time (iterations). Daily stand-up meetings contribute to the monitoring process by exposing potential risk triggers and new risks. Risk reviews examine the effectiveness of risk responses. Combined, these tools help agile project managers monitor project risks.\nD. Pair programming, continuous integration, and automated testing\nIncorrect. Pair programming, continuous integration, and automated testing are examples of agile best practices to deliver high-quality products. These practices are not tools and techniques for monitoring project risks.",

        "question": "A small company is occupying one floor in an office building. A new senior manager has been assigned to oversee several projects. The manager contacts an agile project leader and asks for a monthly report that summarizes the project status and the projected finish date.\n\nHow should the project leader respond to this request?",
        "answer1": "Provide the senior manager with a detailed monthly project status report",
        "answer2": "Suggest that the senior manager periodically attend the daily standups",
        "answer3": "Monthly, demonstrate the product increment to the senior manager",
        "answer4": "Invite the senior manager once a month to review the information radiators",
        "answer5": "",
        "explain": "An information radiator is a visible display that provides information to the rest of the organization enabling up-to-the-minute knowledge sharing without having to disturb the team. A burndown chart is an example of the information radiator that can indicate the progress of a project at a glance. A release burndown chart is typically updated after every iteration, while an iteration burndown chart is updated daily. A burndown chart shows the actual and estimated amount of work to be achieved over time, and is a good indicator of both progress, potential finish dates, and if the team is on target for completing the work based on estimates. Burndown charts are often placed in high-traffic, highly visible locations, so anyone interested can quickly see at a glance the project status. Agile methods seek to minimize documentation that has to be maintained, updated, and distributed such as progress reports in favor of information radiators that can radiate information like project status to a large audience who may not have the expertise required to interpret sophisticated dashboards or scheduling tools.\nNote, the reason the scenario indicates that the company is small and is occupying one floor in an office building is given to allow the reader to understand that inviting the senior manager once a month to review the information radiators is a feasible option. In large companies, especially with geographically distributed project teams, this course of action would not always be possible. Some exam questions, however, do not indicate the specifics of the organization. In those circumstances, reasonable assumptions should be made and, of the choices provided, the best answer to the question asked should be selected.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Provide the senior manager with a detailed monthly project status report\nIncorrect. Agile projects do not create standard project status reports used in traditional projects to report progress. Instead, agile practitioners use information radiators to track project progress and inform the project team, customers, and stakeholders about the project status.\nB. Suggest that the senior manager periodically attend the daily standups\nIncorrect. The daily standup is a meeting that is held by the team members to synchronize their work and report any impediments to progress. Project status and estimated completion date are not presented during this meeting. Daily standups are typically not open for attendance by customers, stakeholders, or members of management.\nC. Monthly, demonstrate the product increment to the senior manager\nIncorrect. In agile projects, the demonstration of a product increment typically takes place at the iteration review meeting. While demonstrating product increments monthly for the senior manager can be done, this approach is neither completely aligned with agile practices, nor will it provide the project status and/or completion date to the manager.\nD. Invite the senior manager once a month to review the information radiators\nCorrect. Information radiators, such as burn charts, are used to show the work that has been completed, the work remaining, and the forecasted date of completion. The typical burndown chart is a graph that plots the amount of work versus time or iterations remaining. As work is completed, a progress line on the chart moves downward to reflect the decreasing amount of remaining work.",

        "question": "During a meeting, the agile coach proposes that the team implement a defined process for reporting defects on their online tracking tool. Since the team members are well familiar with the tool from their past projects, they, by consensus, agree that they do not need to waste their time discussing this matter. The agile coach is unhappy.\n\nWhat is the best nest step for the agile coach?",

        "answer3": "Praise the team for their choice",
        "answer4": "Force the team to use the tool",
        "answer5": "",
        "explain": "One of the duties of servant leaders is to create an open and safe environment by encouraging conversation and experimentation. This course of action would help surface problems and impediments that are slowing the team down or preventing its ability to deliver value. Being honest with the team and encouraging them to discuss issues is an important aspect of the agile coach role. However, the agile coach cannot force the team towards a solution or dictate the defect tracking standards. Since the issue is not critical, letting the team members experiment with their own process and allowing them to fail is a better approach.\nAs stated by the author in the reference, \"Certainly, don't stand idly by while the team goes careening off a cliff. But you should use the dozens of opportunities that arise in each sprint to let them fail.\" It would be best for the agile coach to use this opportunity and allow the team to learn from their own experience. This experience may help the team not only come up with the process of how they should capture defects on their online tracking tool, but it can also help them work better together as a team.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Wait and see if the team experiences fast failure\nCorrect. Fast failure is one of the concepts used in agile projects. The idea behind the concept is that if a project/process/initiative is doomed to fail, it's better to let it fail fast so that organizational resources are not wasted. Therefore, instead of arguing with the team, it's better for the agile coach to let the team fail (assuming this failure does not jeopardize the entire project, which is not the case according to the scenario described).\nB. Document defects tracking process\nIncorrect. There is nothing wrong with documenting the defects tracking process. However, it is unlikely that by documenting this process, the agile coach would persuade the team members toward using a defined process for reporting defects on their online tracking tool.\nC. Praise the team for their choice\nIncorrect. It is apparent from the scenario that the agile coach is unhappy with the team's choice. Therefore, praising the team for their choice, pretending it was a good one, would be a hypocritical response for the agile coach.\nD. Force the team to use the tool\nIncorrect. Forcing decisions on an agile team is the last resort, which would make sense only in emergencies. Implementing a defined process for reporting defects on a tracking tool is far from being an emergency.",

Therefore, further investigation needs to be completed before acting on data from one process.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Reward the team member for finishing the activity ahead of schedule\nIncorrect. You certainly want to reward employees for good work, but at this point, you don't know if the activity was completed correctly or if the team member completed other activities on time. A further investigation would be warranted.\nB. Investigate further to determine if there is a problem\nCorrect. You can't get a good understanding of how the project is performing against the project plan by only monitoring one aspect of the project.

Once you have investigated further, you will know if there is a discrepancy between your planned and actual estimates.\nC.

Just because the team member worked half the hours, you had planned for her to work on an activity doesn't mean you estimated incorrectly. Perhaps there are other reasons for the discrepancy.

Based on the result of your investigation, you can issue a corrective action, if necessary.\nD. Do nothing now and wait for the next month's progress data.\nIncorrect.

While managing the project team, the project manager makes reward decisions and implements them as part of the team development process. Unless the need arises to change the recognition plan, a project manager should adhere to the project plan. Since the work of creating a recognition and reward system should have already been done, the project manager's best approach would be to consult the resource management plan.\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Give rewards to team members who meet their performance goals at the end of the project\nIncorrect. Although this could be a good strategy, giving the team recognition throughout the project's life cycle rather than waiting until the project is completed would be a better course of action. Additionally, giving rewards without consulting the resource management plan first may go against the pre-determined process.\nB. Give all team members a salary raise to help motivate them\nIncorrect. Aside from being unrealistic in some cases, this approach is unlikely to be effective since the reward (the salary raise) is not tied to a specific behavior. A better strategy is to give rewards and recognition to employees who demonstrate desirable behavior. Regardless, this is not the first thing that should be done in the scenario described.\nC. Hold a contest where team members can compete for prizes\nIncorrect. Contests often focus on win-lose rewards, where one team member wins, and others do not. This can adversely affect team morale and group cohesion. A better course of action focuses on win-win rewards that promote team building and reward or recognize desirable behaviors. However, the resource management plan should be consulted first.\nD. Consult the resource management plan\nCorrect. The project manager should first consult the resource management plan since there may already be a plan or strategy in place for the project manager to follow.

        "explain": "The question implies that the project is operating in a hybrid environment. A hybrid project incorporates elements of predictive and agile methodologies. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the project has at least a basic project management plan. The team charter is a document that records the team values, agreements, and operating guidelines, as well as establishes expectations regarding acceptable behavior by project team members. The scenario implies that the team charter either was not created or did not adequately cover standard working hours and respecting team members' personal time. A team charter is a useful document that can be incorporated into any project regardless of the project management framework. When a project management plan exists, the team charter is created as an output of the Plan Resource Management process as an element of the resource management plan. Had the project manager facilitated a meeting to define the team working agreements and recorded the agreements in the team charter, the situation described by the question might have been avoided or, at least, its impact reduced.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Facilitated a meeting to develop a team charter as part of the Plan Resource Management process\nCorrect. The question implies that the team's working agreements were not developed or are insufficient. Creating the team working agreements earlier in project planning could have helped avoid the situation described in the scenario or, at least, could have reduced its severity.\nB. Established team working agreements during the daily standups and iteration planning meetings\nIncorrect. The daily standup is a timeboxed agile ceremony during which the project team reviews progress from the previous day, declare intentions for the current day, and identifies any impediments to their work. Iteration planning is mainly aimed to set up goals for the upcoming iteration. Although the lack of team working agreements might be identified as an impediment during the daily standup, neither daily standup nor iteration planning meetings are appropriate forums to create a team charter.\nC. Selected a team of only senior developers using the pre-assignment tool during project initiation\nIncorrect. It would be nice to have the option of selecting only experienced team members for your project. However, this option is not always available. Experienced developers are typically a scarce resource for which concurrent projects in the performing organization are likely to \"fight\".\nD. Nothing could have been done differently since agile teams should accept working at all hours.\nIncorrect. There is no standard within agile best practices that suggests that team members must be available at all hours.

        "explain": "The scenario implies the project is in the Plan Procurement Management process. When some aspects of the procurement are well-defined up-front but others are unknown or variable, the parties to the contract may use a multi-tiered contract structure. This contracting technique allows for capturing various aspects of the procurement in different documents. For example, mostly fixed items, such as warranties and arbitration, can be locked in a master services agreement (MSA), while more dynamic items, such as scope, schedule, and budget, can be formalized in a lightweight statement of work. In the scenario, the scope is subject to change and will be elaborated as the project progresses. Therefore, while contracting with the seller, the lightweight statement of work would be the project manager's best choice to address the scope part of the procurement. This multi-tiered contract structure reflects a hybrid project management approach in which part of the procurement is managed using predictive methods, while the other part is addressed with agile contracting techniques.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Master services agreement\nIncorrect. A master services agreement (MSA) is a contract between the buyer and seller that can be used with a hybrid project management approach when the overall engagement for the contracted work is documented in the main part of the MSA, while the adaptive portion of the work is placed in an appendix or supplement. While the MSA is a plausible answer, it's not the best. Another answer choice precisely addresses the question asked.\nB. Lightweight statement of work\nCorrect. The lightweight statement of work can be used to contract with the seller for those work items that cannot be defined up-front and will likely change as the project progresses. In the scenario, the scope meets this criterion and, therefore, is a good candidate to be addressed by such a statement of work, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.\nC. Source selection analysis\nIncorrect. Source selection analysis is one of the tools and techniques that can be used as part of the Plan Procurement Management process implied by the scenario. This analysis is used, as its name implies, to select a seller for the procurement, rather than address the variable parts of the procured work, as asked by the question.\nD.

The CPI is $650, and the project is running under planned costs.\nIncorrect. The cost variance (CV) can be calculated as earned value (EV) minus actual costs (AC) which is $650. However, the question is asking for the CPI and not the CV.\nB. The CPI is 0.83, and the project is running over budget.\nIncorrect. The current cost performance index (CPI) can be calculated by dividing current earned value (EV) by the current actual costs (AC). If EV and AC are transposed in the formula, the result is 0.83, making this choice an incorrect answer.\nC. The CPI is 1.21, and the project is running under planned costs.\nCorrect. The current cost performance index (CPI) can be calculated by dividing current earned value (EV) by the current actual costs (AC). The EV is the sum of the planned work completed, which, in this case, is 100% of activity 1, 75% of activity 2, and 50% of activity 3. The AC is the sum of the costs for the first three activities. CPI = EV / AC = $3,750 / $3,100 = 1.21. Since the CPI of 1.21 is greater than 1.0, the project is running under planned costs.\nD. The CPI is 1.0, and the project is on budget.\nIncorrect. If the CPI were at 1.0, then the project would be on budget. However, when calculated correctly, the CPI is 1.21 meaning the project is currently running under planned costs.",

        "question": "An agile project team begins the development of the project deliverables. The sponsor stresses the importance of having the stakeholders apprised of value gain progress as often as possible.\n\nWhat is the best way for the project manager to address the sponsor's request?",

        "answer2": "Demonstrate the product at the end of each iteration",
        "answer3": "Perform the earned value analysis on a daily basis",
        "answer4": "Colocate the stakeholders with the team members",
        "answer5": "",
        "explain": "Agile best practices encourage continuous involvement of project stakeholders in the product development. This approach allows the stakeholders to be constantly updated with the progress of the project and provide feedback to the project team as to how well the product (or service) meets stakeholder expectations. To apprise stakeholders of value gain progress, agile teams that develop project deliverables using iterations hold product demonstrations at the end of each iteration. At these agile events, the team members demonstrate the working product increment to the stakeholders, who, in turn, have the opportunity firsthand to see and touch (depending on the nature of the deliverables) the actual product. Therefore, of the choices provided, demonstrating the product at the end of each iteration is the best answer to the question asked.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Provide the stakeholders with value stream mapping\nIncorrect. Value stream mapping is a lean enterprise technique used to document, analyze, and improve the flow of information or materials required to produce a product service for a customer. This technique is typically used by agile teams to identify waste in their process, reduce process cycle times, and implement process improvement. Apprising stakeholders of value gain progress is not achieved by this technique.\nB. Demonstrate the product at the end of each iteration\nCorrect. This answer choice describes an iteration review meeting, which is an agile event specifically designed to apprise stakeholders of value gain progress. The team demonstrates the product increment developed in the iteration and seeks for stakeholder feedback. A working product increment provides value for the customer.\nC. Perform the earned value analysis on a daily basis\nIncorrect. An earned value analysis (EVA) is an example of the data analysis tools and techniques that is used to compare the performance measurement baseline to the actual schedule and cost performance. While this technique can also be used in agile projects, performing the EVA on a daily basis is not the most effective way to apprise stakeholders of value gain progress. Demonstrating a working product increment to stakeholders more accurately addresses the question asked as well as is better aligned with agile best practices.\nD. Colocate the stakeholders with the team members\nIncorrect. Colocating the stakeholders with the team members would likely allow the stakeholders to see the project progress in real-time. On the other hand, this course of action may negatively impact the productivity of the team as its reasonable to assume that the stakeholders will interrupt the workflow by asking questions about the progress. Besides, the concept of colocation refers to the team members, rather than the team members and stakeholders.",

During project planning, existing government regulations regarding the new technology were virtually non-existent. You identified this ambiguity risk during project planning and developed a risk response. Now, with the car ready for production, new regulations have been enacted. The new regulations are so complicated that you have trouble understanding them and their implications for the project.\n\nWhat should you do next?",
        "answer1": "Seek the opinion of a recognized expert to validate or modify the risk response",

        "answer4": "Proceed with the project and implemented the risk response as originally planned",
        "answer5": "",
        "explain": "The question suggests that you, as the project manager, are performing the Implement Risk Responses process to address the ambiguity risk presented by the new regulations. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge to validate or modify risk responses if necessary and decide how to implement them in the most efficient and effective manner. Expert judgment will be vital in understanding the new regulations before the risk response plan can be modified to ensure compliance with the new regulatory environment. According to the scenario described, the new regulations are so complicated that you have trouble understanding them and their implications for the project. Therefore, among the available choices, the next step for you before taking action is to seek the opinion of a recognized expert to understand the new regulations in order to implement the risk response to ensure compliance.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Seek the opinion of a recognized expert to validate or modify the risk response\nCorrect. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge to validate or modify risk responses if necessary and decide how to implement them in the most efficient and effective manner.\nB. Terminate the project since the new technology does not meet the new regulations\nIncorrect. Terminating the project at this point in the project is a premature action. It is not known how the new regulations will impact the new car's design. First, the new laws should be studied and understood before making any decisions regarding the future of the project.\nC. Submit a change request to alter the scope baseline to accommodate the new regulations\nIncorrect. An approved change request is required to update the scope baseline, and the project scope may need to be modified to comply with the new regulations. However, since you as a project manager have troubles to understand them, the new regulations must first be understood before the car's design can be altered to comply with the new rules.\nD. Proceed with the project and implemented the risk response as originally planned\nIncorrect. Typically, when an identified risk for which a response has been planned is realized, the response is implemented. However, according to the scenario, there are more variables associated with the risk that can impact project constraints implying that the original risk response may be inadequate.

        "explain": "The project described in this scenario combines elements of the traditional and agile project management approaches. According to the scenario, the new developer is highly qualified; however, he/she is not familiar with the project, the project team, or the performing organization. You, as the servant leader, need to ensure that the new developer has all of the knowledge and skills that will be necessary to be a productive team member. One strategy for developing the new team member would be to give him the opportunity to be mentored by the other team members. Pair programming is a practice that is derived from eXtreme Programming (XP), where two developers work side-by-side to write the software code. This strategy would facilitate the process of mentoring the new developer. While working in close proximity to one another, the interactions between team members would allow transferring various types of knowledge, not only technical aspects of the Scrum framework but also information about the organization, whether this information will be formal or casual.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Request the team members to rotate with pair programming so that each team member has an opportunity to mentor the new developer\nCorrect. Pair programming is one of the eXtreme Programming (XP) best practices, where two developers work side-by-side to write the software code. This strategy would be one way for the team members to impart their knowledge and expertise about the Scrum framework and the performing organization to the new developer.\nB. Ask the new developer to review the organizational breakdown structure and the Scrum Guide and assess the knowledge gained\nIncorrect. As always, we are looking for the best choice of those provided. While this choice technically represents a plausible answer, there is another answer that better addresses the question asked and would likely have a greater positive impact on how the new developer gets familiar with the new organization, team, and development methods.\nC. Have the new developer review the product backlog and ask him to select the user story with which he would prefer to begin his work\nIncorrect. One should distinguish between the product backlog and sprint backlog. The sprint backlog is derived from the product backlog based on the priority specified by the product owner in collaboration with the team. Developers do not get to select work from the product backlog based on their preferences.\nD. Hold an outdoor team-building exercise and invite the sponsor, key project stakeholders, and customer representative\nIncorrect. This answer choice sounds like a fun and may indeed help the new developer familiarize himself with the organization.

Always look for the 'best' answer even when the question does not explicitly ask for this. In the scenario described, the project manager, risk owner, and project team member all share responsibility for the failure to complete the execution of the risk response. However, even though others share responsibility, the project manager is ‘ultimately’ responsible, or, in other words, accountable, for the achievement of the project objectives. The project manager can delegate tasks and assignments but cannot delegate the accountability for ensuring that those tasks and assignments are completed. Therefore, of the available choices, saying that the project manager is accountable for ensuring the implementation of the risk response plan is the best answer to the question asked.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Risk owner\nIncorrect. The risk owner certainly shares some of the blame for the lack of execution of the risk response plan. However, the project manager and not the risk owner is ultimately responsible, or accountable, for all aspects of the project including the implementation of risk responses. Even though the risk owner was assigned responsibility for implementing the risk response, it is the project manager's responsibility to ensure that assigned tasks are completed.\nB. Project manager\nCorrect.

        "explain": "Knowledge can be broken down into two types, including explicit and tacit knowledge. Explicit knowledge can be readily codified, and the question implies that only explicit knowledge is being transferred to the other project teams. Tacit knowledge (beliefs, insights, experience, and know-how) is very difficult to codify. Codified explicit knowledge lacks context and is open to misinterpretation. Tacit knowledge can more easily be transferred through communication and personal interaction. The scenario describes a hybrid project, in which the project manager has effectively transferred the codified explicit knowledge. However, the project manager did not capture the tacit knowledge residing in the minds of the project team members (for reasons described above). Having the other project managers attend the project retrospective and interact with the project with the team members would better facilitate the transfer of tacit knowledge.\nNote, having the other project managers attend the project retrospective is not always feasible for various reasons. However, as far as the exam is concerned, one should select the answer that best addresses the question asked, regardless of how unrealistic the answer may look and feel. Not all questions and/or answer choices on the real exam would make perfect sense. We hope that encountering such questions in the simulated exam would better prepare you for the real one.\n\nDetails for Each Option:\nA. Ensured that the tacit knowledge gained during the project is recorded and codified in the lessons learned repository\nIncorrect. The scenario does imply that tacit knowledge is being lost by simply recording information in the lessons learned register. However, codifying tacit knowledge is very difficult due to its nature. This type of knowledge is more effectively transferred by conversations and personal interactions.\nB. Updated the organizational process assets with the knowledge gained from the project as part of project closure\nIncorrect. The lessons learned repository is an organizational process asset. The lessons learned register is finalized and transferred to the lessons learned repository as part of project closure. Therefore, this answer choice represents an activity that has already been completed.\nC. Invited the other project managers to attend the project retrospective so the tacit knowledge can also be transferred\nCorrect. The question suggests that tacit knowledge is being lost since only explicit knowledge has been captured in the lessons learned register. Having other project managers attend the project retrospective and interact with the team members who have carried out the work on this project would help facilitate the transfer of tacit knowledge.\nD. Developed a more robust knowledge management plan as part of the Plan Knowledge Management process\nIncorrect.
